// Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

// We start with the second element of the array as the first element is assumed to be sorted.
// Compare the second element with the first element if the second element is smaller then swap them.
// Move to the third element, compare it with the first two elements, and put it in its correct position
// Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

// C++ program for implementation of Insertion Sort
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* Function to sort array using insertion sort */

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;

        /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
           greater than key, to one position ahead
           of their current position */
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
